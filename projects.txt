1. BHB-BS separation. Work with larger sample of spectra in a wider window. With the Sgr selection, try to come up with a better classification system.

2. MaNGA data. Perform BFE fits, to various quantities. Try out the noise projection.

3. Katelin should be running new simulations. Tailor the satellites to create new models, -or- run BFE simulations after the fact to make higher-resolution samples.
